# - 👋 Hi, I’m @thespamster

I am currently studying for a Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development
through the College of West Anglia and Code Institute. This is all very new 
to me as my course started on the 18/05/23. I am however very focussed on 
completing this diploma within the maximum allowed time of 12 months. This
is a wonderful opportunity to change what I do and I intend to do exactly that.

interest in playing guitar, extreme metal, sci-fi/fantasy and in particular Dr. 
Who we should probably have a chat at some point.
