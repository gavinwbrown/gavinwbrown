# - 👋 Hi, I’m @thespamster

I studied for a Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development
through the Code Institute affiliated with The College Of West Anglia.
Circumstance has moved quickly and I took the decision to start
my own business '4uxdesign' and become a freelance full-stack web
developer. Life has become more interesting than I could have possibly
imagined. Sometimes though you simply have to take a chance and go for it.

### - 👀 I’m interested in ...

Connecting with anybody that can help me on my journey plus if you have an
interest in playing guitar, extreme metal or K-pop (I know, a strange combination)
, sci-fi/fantasy and in particular Dr. Who we should probably have a chat at 
some point.

### - 🌱 I have learned the following ...

HTML, CSS (incl. Bootstrap,Tailwind), Javascript, Python, Flask, Jinja, SQL Alchemy, PostgreSQL, Django and more

### - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

Any project big or small, paid or unpaid that allows me to expand my knowledge of coding.

### - 📫 How to reach me ...

If you have a project that you think I can help with then feel free to reach me by...
