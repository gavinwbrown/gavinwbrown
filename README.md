# - 👋 Hi, I’m @thespamster

I am currently studying for a Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development
through the Code Institute affiliated with The College Of West Anglia. This is 
all very new to me as my course started on the 18/05/23 having taken the five day
coding challenge. Within a week of taking the challenge I had a student loan in 
place, enrolled and started my coding journey. Circumstance has moved quickly and
I recently took the decision to start my own business '4uxdesign' and having
secured some startup funding and a potential source of leads life has become
more interesting than I could have possibly imagined just a few short months 
ago. Sometimes though you simply have to take a chance and go for it.

### - 👀 I’m interested in ...

Connecting with anybody that can help me achieve my goals plus if you have an
interest in playing guitar, extreme metal or K-pop (I know, a strange combination)
, sci-fi/fantasy and in particular Dr. Who we should probably have a chat at 
some point.

### - 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

HTML, CSS (incl. Bootstrap), Javascript, Python, Flask, Jinja, SQL Alchemy, PostgreSQL, and Django.
### - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

Anything that will enable me to improve my portfolio and 
rapidly gain experience in the field of web development.
